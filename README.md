### Hey Antonio here 👋

I'm student of the first batch of 🧠 **`Artificial Intelligence Engineering`** at the University of San Andrés, Argentina, and 👨‍💻 **`Full-Stack Developer`** passionate about technology and change 🌍


🤓 I have a strong interest in building digital solutions that bring value to society 🌍. I am also a lover of **`Entrepreneurship`** and **`Numbers`** who believes that the fusion between Entrepreneurship and the Academic world will lead to the construction of solutions that will improve the quality of life of people.
